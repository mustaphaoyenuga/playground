## 💡 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A sandbox for practicing and improving my frontend skills
- A showcase of quick builds and creative solutions
- A learning ground for trying out different patterns and approaches

## 🚧 Adding New Projects

Each project follows a simple structure:
1. Create a new directory with a descriptive kebab-case name
2. Add a `README.md` explaining what it does
3. Build the project from scratch as a self-contained module. It shouldn't be vibe coded.
4. Update this main README with a link
